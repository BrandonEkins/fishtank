# IOT Fish Tank

## Project Outline

The goal of this project is to simplify the different tasks associated with taking care of fish. This is applicable to me as I eventually want to go from my little 1 fish fish tank to a nice aqua-scape. 

## Project Parts

1. Raspberry Pi Event Hub
    - Raspberry Pi 3b

2. Tank Cleanliness sensor
    - Photo Resistor 
    - Wemos D1 Mini
    - LED Light

3. Tank Temperature gauge 
    - Wemos D1 Mini 
    - Thermometer

4. Feeder/Feeding Monitor
    - Wemos D1 Mini
    - Servo (Small motor)
    - 3D Printed Hopper

5. Button
    - Wemos D1 Mini
    - Button
    - OLED Display

## Final Project

Apply the principles you have learned in this class by designing your own IoT system that solves a real-life need. These don’t have to be massive, world-changing needs, but should be useful in your personal life.

Some examples are:

“In my apartment complex, I never know when my clothes are done in the dryer in the laundry room. I want to build a small device that recognized when the dryer finishes, and then flashes LEDs in a few rooms in my apartment.”

“I worry about packages being stolen from my front porch. I want to design a large box for packages that can be physically attached to my porch. When empty, the box is unlocked. When a package is placed inside and the box is closed, it takes a picture and sends me a message then locks itself until I come home and click a button on my phone to unlock it.”

It could be a system to monitor your pet’s food or water. It could be something to show if the dishwasher is clean or dirty. It could check the temperature in a room and turn on or off a fan or outlet.

For the project, you will need to build a system that meets the following minimum technical requirements:

Utilize at least 3 physical devices (one sensor and two actuators, or two sensors and one actuator)

Utilize at least 2 wireless communication protocols (wifi, BLE, RFID, LoRa, etc)
wifi, mqtt & web interface
Utilize restful API

Utilize event hub or cloud IoT service
mqtt on raspberry pi
Utilize a non-web page interface (voice, IFTTT, chat)
slackbot
